## Replication Code Summary

We did the replication experiment on a two-layer fully connected neural network on the MNIST dataset. Our experiments include:

- **Implemented the experimental neural network, the robustness function and the visual demonstration codes.** [Section2, Section3, Section 4]

- **Generated adversarial samples using DeepFool as the experimental group and FGSM as the control group. Adversarial samples on the MNIST dataset are shown in the colab file.** [Section 3]

- **Attacked the neural network using DeepFool and FGSM correspondingly and did quantitative analysis on the results (accuracy and speed).** [Section 4] 

- **Fine-tuned the model using adversarial samples generated by DeepFool and FGSM. Evaluated the fine-tuned models.** [Section 5]

- **Reproduced the over-perturbed experiment in the fine-tuning process.** [Section 5]
