## Replication Summary

We did the replication experiment on a two-layer fully connected neural network on the MNIST dataset. Our experiments include:

- Implemented the experimental neural network, the robustness function and the visual demostration codes.

- Generated adversarial samples using DeepFool as the experimental group and FGSM as the control group. Adversarial samples on the MNIST dataset are shown in section 3 of the replication code.

- Attacked the neural network using DeepFool and FGSM correspondingly and did quantitative analysis on the results (accuracy and speed). [Section 4 in the colab file] 

- Fine-tuned the model using adversarial samples generated by DeepFool and FGSM. Evaluated the fine-tuned models. [section 5 in the colab file]

- Reproduced the over-perpurbed fine-tuning experiment [section 5]
